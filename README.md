Meshery adapter for Octarine

## How the Meshery Adapter for Octarine Works
The Octarine adapter relys on an existing control plane already being up. Octarine provides a shared control plane for all Meshery users.
In order to deploy Octarine's dataplane into a target cluster the adapter performs the follwing operations:
* A new account is provisioned in the Octarine Control Plane.
* A domain is registered in that account. A domain in Octarine identified a k8s cluster.
* The YAML files required for deploying the data plane on the target cluster are generated.
* The YAML files are applied on the `octarine-dataplane` namespace in the target cluster.

Once the Octarine's data plane services are deployed, the adapter can be used to deploy Bookinfo. The steps here are:
* Enable the target namespace for automatic sidecar injection.
* Deploy Bookinfo to the target namespace.

## Environement Variables
In order to connect to the Octarine Control Plane the adapter requires the follwing environment variables to be set:
* OCTARINE_DOCKER_USERNAME: The docker username needed to pull Octarine's images to the target cluster. Do not use your own docker credentials. Use the ones supplies by Octarine.
* OCTARINE_DOCKER_EMAIL: The docker username needed to pull Octarine's images to the target cluster.
* OCTARINE_DOCKER_PASSWORD: The docker username needed to pull Octarine's images to the target cluster.
* OCTARINE_ACC_MGR_PASSWD : The password that will be assigned to the user 'meshery' in the new account.
* OCTARINE_CREATOR_PASSWD : The password needed to create an account in Octarine.
* OCTARINE_DELETER_PASSWD : The password needed to delete the account in Octarine.
* OCTARINE_CP : The address of the Octarine Control Plane. Example: meshery-cp.octarinesec.com
* OCTARINE_DOMAIN : The name that will be assigned to the target cluster in Octarine. Example: meshery:domain
